# Burger App

## What: 
  The objective was to create a burger app that lets the user name their burger, and say whether it has been eaten or not. If the burger hasn't been eaten, the app allows the user to click a button that moves the burger to the "devoured" column. Once a burger is eaten you cannot un-eat it! 

## Why:
    this activity utilized handlebars, express, MySQL, and ORMs.  

## How:
    I used examples from past activites to structure my files and folders as some of these applications are very specific on their organization. I then went through by functionality and made sure it worked front to back and back again all the way through before moving onto the next piece. 

## Features:
    My page features three columns, the left side where the list of eaten burgers lives, the center where a user can add a burger, and the right side where the un-eaten burgers live. 

## Difficulties:
    I found it hard to connect the flow between the pages, for example I foud the call back functions to be very confusing and complicated. I also forgot how the end product was supposed to look since we didnt have a gif of the assingment, but i tried my best!
